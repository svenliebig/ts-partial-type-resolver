# TypeScript Partial Type Resolver

Under Construction üèó

But feel free to look around!

---

This project has it's motiviation from creating mock data. I want to resolve types without compiling the whole project, and just load these types that I need. The goal is to resolve types like this:

```ts
type Person = {
	address: Address;
	name: string;
};
```

Into types like this:

```ts
type Person = {
	address: {
		street: string;
		state: string;
		city: string;
		postalcode: number;
	};
	name: string;
};
```
